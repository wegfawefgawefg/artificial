Great suggestion ‚Äî I refactored the number formatting and key/value rendering into global UI helpers and integrated them.

What I changed

- Global UI helpers (in src/main.cpp):
    - fmt2(float) -> std::string: formats with 2 decimals.
    - ui_draw_kv_line(SDL_Renderer*, TTF_Font*, int tx, int& ty, int lh, const char* key, const std::string& value, ...): draws a key/value
on the same line at tx,ty, then increments ty by lh.
- Replaced inline lambdas with calls to these helpers in:
    - Center ground-inspect panel (V toggle): all gun and ammo stats use ui_draw_kv_line and fmt2.
    - Right-side equipped gun panel: all gun stats and ammo stats use ui_draw_kv_line and fmt2.
- Cleaned up old inline helpers to avoid -Werror warnings; build is clean.

Behavior

- Numbers in inspect panels are 2-decimal where appropriate (e.g., deviation, recoil, control, AR values, multipliers).
- Ammo stats are indented and neatly aligned with key/value style for readability.
- The overall layout matches the styled approach you shared: clear keys, tidy values, consistent formatting.

Build status

- Compiles without warnings (Werror clean).

Want me to extend the same key/value style to the inventory hover panel too, or keep that one simpler?

yes, but update the docs with what you did ur out of context.

Updating documentation

I need to update the documentation to include all the changes we've made, like the ammo system, gun compatibility, and UI formatting. I‚Äôm
trying to figure out which files to update in the docs directory‚Äîspecifically, agent_guide.txt, todo_high_level.md, and stats_and_triggers.md
for API changes. I think we should reflect completed tasks in the todo lists and adjust the done.txt file to log session changes. I‚Äôll also
include details about new fields and semantics for register_ammo and mention specifics like ammo penetration.

Documenting input changes

I need to document the changes regarding the V key, which now toggles the gun panel instead of following the camera. I should note
the removal of the camera-follow toggle, as the state.camera_follow_enabled is always true by default now. I also need to include
updates about Lua APIs like set_equipped_ammo and set_equipped_ammo_force, which enforce compatibility and show alerts. I'll update the
stats_and_triggers.md and agent_guide, log completed tasks in done.txt, and mark progress in the high-level bullets with [Done] tags.

Updating documentation and patches

I need to mention the ammo hooks in my updates. I‚Äôll start by updating docs/agent_guide.txt to add items to the Lua API listing, like

Code recap of doc-relevant changes

- Ammo system:
    - register_ammo implemented; guns declare compatible_ammo; ammo chosen at gun spawn or via API.
    - Damage model: entity armor penetration, shield multiplier, range and linear falloff, pierce_count for entities only.
    - Ammo hooks called on projectile hits.
    - APIs: api.set_equipped_ammo, api.set_equipped_ammo_force.
    - APIs: api.set_equipped_ammo, api.set_equipped_ammo_force.
- 
UI:
    - Right gun panel toggle via V; shows gun + ammo info, sprites, 2-decimal formatting.
    - Center hover panel for inventory; also shows ground inspect when overlapping targets and V is ON.
    - Inventory list shows icons and supports drag-and-drop reordering.

All changes build cleanly with Werror.
